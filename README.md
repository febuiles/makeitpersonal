Lyric Fetching Service
----
You can fetch lyrics from the website using a simple GET request to
`http://makeitpersonal.co/lyrics`. It expects two parameters, `artist` (artist name) and `title`
(song title). Try it out in the command line:

    curl -s "https://makeitpersonal.co/lyrics?artist=Protest%20the%20Hero&title=Tandem"
